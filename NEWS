libdbi-drivers NEWS file
========================

_____________________________________
0.8.0 (the "Whatsername" release)

- and then there were 7: sqlite3, firebird, and oracle were
  added. However, msql, oracle, and firebird are still experimental in
  this release and are likely to be broke. We'll do our best to ship
  working drivers with 0.8.1

- tons of internal fixes to work with libdbi 0.8.0

- the version numbering has changed. Starting with this release, the
  major and minor numbers ("0.8" in this release) denote the internal
  API version. Any 0.8.x libdbi-drivers release is guaranteed to work
  with any 0.8.x libdbi release. The patch level ("0" in the current
  release) denotes patches and minor changes that do not affect the
  internal API.


_____________________________________
0.7.0 (the "Pineapple Skunk" release)

- the libdbi-drivers project now hosts 4 drivers: mysql and pgsql
  (formerly part of libdbi), as well as msql and sqlite.

- fixed dynamic loading stuff to work properly on OSX

- added/updated driver documentation

- improved test program

- assorted fixes in the drivers

- sqlite driver now attempts to support all MySQL and PosgreSQL data
  types
