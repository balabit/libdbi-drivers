libdbi-drivers NEWS file
========================

_____________________________________
0.8.2 (the "Payday in a Pub" release)

- to avoid possible conflicts with database client libraries (think
  package names!) all driver libraries were renamed from libname.suffix
  to libdbdlibname.suffix. E.g. the MySQL shared library was renamed from
  mysql.so to libdbdmysql.so. Unless your package manager does this
  automatically, it is recommended to clean out old driver libraries
  from /usr/local/lib/dbd (or wherever they ended up).
  Remember that this change affects only the library names. The driver
  names (the ones your program uses to load particular drivers) did
  *not* change 
- assorted fixes in the oracle driver
- the mysql driver now supports the BIT and NEWDECIMAL types
  introduced in MySQL 5.0.3
- added a new (experimental) Ingres 2006 driver
- the "--disable-docs" configure switch now allows to build
  libdbi-drivers without having the sgml toolchain installed
- plugged a few memory holes
- fixed a segfault in the error message handling code of sqlite/sqlite3
- improved compatibility with older PostgreSQL versions
- sqlite and sqlite3 now grok semicolons in query strings
- you can now optionally link the drivers against libdbi by using the
  "--enable-libdbi" configure switch. This sounds weird at first, but it
  allows to load libdbi into a dlopen'ed module, like this:

  Parent => dl_open(module) => dl_open(libdbi) => dl_open(driver)

  Drivers compiled with this option should work ok in the regular
  context (your app linked against libdbi) as well.


__________________________
0.8.1 (the "Lost" release)

Due to a lack of attention there was no release information added at
the time of the 0.8.1 release. It is therefore entirely obscure what
made us feel like wrapping up a new release, but rest assured that
this code was better than before (if you really need to know, use the
CVS logs or the CVS web interface).

_____________________________________
0.8.0 (the "Whatsername" release)

- and then there were 7: sqlite3, firebird, and oracle were
  added. However, msql, oracle, and firebird are still experimental in
  this release and are likely to be broke. We'll do our best to ship
  working drivers with 0.8.1

- tons of internal fixes to work with libdbi 0.8.0

- the version numbering has changed. Starting with this release, the
  major and minor numbers ("0.8" in this release) denote the internal
  API version. Any 0.8.x libdbi-drivers release is guaranteed to work
  with any 0.8.x libdbi release. The patch level ("0" in the current
  release) denotes patches and minor changes that do not affect the
  internal API.


_____________________________________
0.7.0 (the "Pineapple Skunk" release)

- the libdbi-drivers project now hosts 4 drivers: mysql and pgsql
  (formerly part of libdbi), as well as msql and sqlite.

- fixed dynamic loading stuff to work properly on OSX

- added/updated driver documentation

- improved test program

- assorted fixes in the drivers

- sqlite driver now attempts to support all MySQL and PosgreSQL data
  types
