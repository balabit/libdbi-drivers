libdbi-drivers - drivers for libdbi, a database abstraction
layer implemented in C
Copyright (C) 2001-2007, Markus Hoenicka

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi (http://libdbi.sourceforge.net) implements a
database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the DBI/DBD
layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous
database connections by using this framework.

libdbi-drivers (http://libdbi-drivers.sourceforge.net) supplies the
drivers that the libdbi framework utilizes to talk to the supported
database servers.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Make sure you have both the libdbi framework installed and the
development libraries and headers of the database engine(s) that you
want to build the driver(s) for. Perform the regular ./configure,
make, make install. See INSTALL for the generic details of each
step. It is important to understand that you have to request the
driver(s) that you want to build on the configure command
line. E.g. to build both the SQLite and the PostgreSQL drivers, use
"./configure --with-sqlite --with-pgsql". See ./configure --help for
more libdbi-drivers configuration options.

If you are building the Win32 port, see README.win32.
If you are building the OSX port, see README.osx.
