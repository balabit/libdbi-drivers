libdbi-drivers - 3rd party drivers for libdbi, a database abstraction
layer implemented in C

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
connections by using this framework.

libdbi-drivers supplies additional drivers for databases not covered
by the libdbi core distribution.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Perform the regular ./configure, make, make install. See INSTALL for the
generic details of each step. Some of the libdbi-specific options to configure
that may interest you are: --with-sqlite. This will enable
compilation of the only database drivers that is available currently.
See ./configure --help for more libdbi-drivers configuration options.

If you are building the Win32 port, see README.win32.
