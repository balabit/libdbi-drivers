	<para>
		<ulink url="&www-libdbi;">libdbi</ulink> is a database abstraction
		layer written in C. It implements a framework that can utilize
		separate driver libraries for specific database servers. The <ulink
		url="&www;">libdbi-drivers</ulink> project provides the drivers
		necessary to talk to the supported database servers.
	</para>
	<para>
		This manual provides information about the &dbd-name; driver, which
		provides support for &proper-name; databases. The manual is
		intended for programmers who write applications linked against libdbi
		and who want their applications to use this database backend.
	</para>
	<para>
		Questions and comments about this driver should be sent to the
		libdbi-drivers-devel mailing list (see the <ulink
		url="&www;">website</ulink>). Questions and comments about the libdbi
		library should be sent to the appropriate libdbi mailing list.

	</section>
	<section id="install-build"><title>Build and install the driver</title>
		<para>
			First you have to unpack the libdbi-drivers archive in a suitable
			directory. Unpacking will create a new subdirectory with the
			version number, such as <filename
			class="directory">libdbi-drivers-0.8.0</filename>
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>tar xfvz libdbi-drivers-0.8.0.tar.gz</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			The libdbi-drivers project consists of several drivers that use a
			common build system. Therefore you <emphasis>must</emphasis> explicitly tell
			the configuration script that you want to build the &dbd-name; driver (you
			can list as many drivers as you want to build):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd libdbi-drivers-0.8.0</userinput></screen>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-&dbd-name;</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			Run <command>./configure --help</command> to find out about
			additional options and other available drivers.
		</para>
		<para>
			Then build the driver with the command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput></screen>
		<note>
			<para>
				Please note that you may have to invoke
				<command>gmake</command>, the GNU version of make, on some
				systems.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
			Then install the driver with the command (you'll need root
			permissions to do this):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			To test the operation of the newly installed driver, use the
			command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			This command creates and runs a test program that performs a few
			basic input and output tests.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				If for some reason you need to re-create the
				autoconf/automake-related files, try running <command
				moreinfo="none">./autogen.sh</command>. In some situations,
				the current stable autoconf/automake/libtool versions (as
				found in FreeBSD 4.7 and Debian 3.0) do not cooperate well, so
				it may be necessary to run the older autoconf 2.13. If
				necessary, edit <filename
				moreinfo="none">autogen.sh</filename> so that it will catch
				the older autoconf version on your system.
			</para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="options"><title>Driver options</title>
	<para>
		Before you can initiate a connection, you must usually specify options
		that tell the database driver what to connect to. This driver supports
		the standard options of
		<varname>username</varname>, <varname>password</varname> and
		<varname>dbname</varname>. The latter parameter is in Ingres syntax,
		<literal>[node_id::]dbname[/svr_class]</literal> - 
		see Ingres documentation for details.
		(When running as the Ingres admin user on the same host as the DBMS,
		only the <literal>dbname</literal> is normally required.)
		Sensible defaults will be used for all unspecified options.
	</para>
	<para>
		This driver also offers the following non-standard options, and/or
		redefines the meaning of the following standard options:
	</para>
	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ingres_autocommit</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Set this option to <emphasis>string value</emphasis> "0" 
					to disable Ingres autocommit mode
					for the connection (it is enabled by default).
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
</chapter>

<chapter id="specific"><title>&proper-name;-specific Peculiarities</title>
	<para>
			This chapter lists known peculiarities of the &dbd-name; driver.
			Wherever possible, nonstandard driver behavior is hidden by libdbi's
			abstractions, but occasionally special considerations must be taken or
			extra functionality may be utilized for particular drivers.
		</para>
<variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Ingres environment variables must be set</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>The driver will not be loaded at all by <function>dbi_initialize()</function>
			if the Ingres environment variables are not set (e.g. by <literal>~/.ingIIbash</literal>).
			If the current user or specified user does not have appropriate Ingres privileges,
			the connection will fail ("User authorization check failed" or similar).</para>
			
			<para>When connecting, the driver uses the values of the
			<literal>dbname</literal>, <literal>username</literal> 
			and <literal>password</literal> options, if set.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Autocommit</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>'Autocommit' mode is enabled by default for the DBMS connection.
			In this mode, every query is committed as an individual transaction.</para>
			
			<para>With autocommit disabled (see <literal>ingres_autocommit</literal> connection option),
			a transaction is begun by the first query statement after connection, commit
			or rollback. The transaction remains open until the next explicit commit,
			rollback or disconnection (which implies commit). Commit and rollback
			cannot be done using an OpenAPI query, but must use separate API functions.
			To work around this, the Ingres driver makes a specific check
			for COMMIT and ROLLBACK queries and calls the appropriate API function
			instead of issuing the query.</para>
			
			<para>See Ingres OpenAPI and SQL documentation for more information.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Handling of result sets</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>In the Ingres OpenAPI, result sets must be accessed sequentially.
			Furthermore, Ingres does not provide the row count; this must be determined
			by fetching rows until no more is available. For this reason, the driver
			must fetch all result data into memory immediately after a query. Then
			libdbi functions can be used to get random access to rows as usual.</para>
			
			<para>A workaround, for example if your result sets
			are very large, would be to use SELECT for random access; for example,
			query once to get a set of key values, then issue SELECTs on individual rows
			or smaller subsets of rows.</para>
			
			<para>If your result set or BLOB data is likely to exhaust memory,
			and workarounds such as the above are not appropriate, then you will
			need to use OpenAPI directly to access them sequentially or by segments,
			instead of using libdbi and this driver.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>SEQUENCE functions and autocommit</term>
		<listitem>
			<para><function>dbi_conn_sequence_last()</function> is not usable in Ingres' autocommit mode
			(the default). To use sequences to identify INSERTed rows, first 
			obtain the NEXT VALUE using <function>dbi_conn_sequence_next()</function> then use that 
			sequence value directly in a separate INSERT transaction.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>DATE parsing</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>Parsing DATE columns into timestamp values will only work correctly when
			returned values are in the default (US) date format; i.e.
			<literal>dd-mmm-yyyy [hh:mm:ss]</literal> where <literal>mmm</literal>
			is a partial month name. The parsing routine will accept
			any separators and either a numeric or named month, but the D-M-Y
			ordering is required. If needed, a workaround for date format
			incompatibility is to format into a string using a SQL function
			such as <function>date_gmt(date)</function>.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Version string format</term>
		<listitem>
			<para><function>dbi_conn_get_engine_version_string()</function> returns a
			string like <literal>II 9.0.4 (int.lnx/104)NPTL</literal>
			(internally this is implemented as <literal>SELECT dbmsinfo('_version')</literal>.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Getting database and table lists</term>
		<listitem>
			<para><function>dbi_conn_get_table_list()</function> returns matching objects 
			of all types - tables, views, indexes and partitions -
			in the <literal>iitables</literal> catalog for the named database
			(except those beginning with <literal>ii</literal>, which are reserved for Ingres).
			These names are space padded fixed width fields.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Logging verbosity</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>The driver respects <function>dbd_set_verbosity()</function> level in reporting messages.
			At verbosity 1, only errors and abnormalities are reported;
			at 2, more information is shown; at 3, detailed debugging information is shown.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Blank handling</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>Blanks are preserved in column values (except that DECIMAL and MONEY columns
			are converted to strings, and then stripped of trailing blanks).
			Note that names returned by <function>dbi_conn_get_table_list()</function>
			and <function>dbi_conn_get_db_list()</function> are padded with blanks
			to a fixed width.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Error messages</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>The Ingres OpenAPI may return multiple error messages for a given query/operation.
			The <function>dbi_conn_error()</function> returns the error code only for the
			last error message, but the message text will include all relevant messages. At verbosity level 2,
			errors directly relating to libdbi function calls are logged. At verbosity 3,
			all errors are logged including those caused by API calls made internally by the driver.</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
		<term>Connection options</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>All Ingres option values are specified as strings (using 
			<function>dbi_conn_set_option()</function>).</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
