MYSQL DRIVER:
--------------

A driver providing connectivity to MySQL databases using libmysqlclient
(http://www.mysql.org)

NOTES:
------

To allow for row seeking, results are loaded into memory. This is very
inefficient and may provide a bottleneck for large applications.

DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, DATE and TIME will all be treated as the DBI type of
DATETIME. This is currently a string, but will change in later releases.

WARNING: The DECIMAL type is treated as a string, as it has arbitrary
precision.

Whether or not a trailing \0 value will be added to Binary string can be
configured using:
  dbi_set_option_numeric("mysql_include_trailing_null",1); //include
  dbi_set_option_numeric("mysql_include_trailing_null",0); //don't include
