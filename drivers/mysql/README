MYSQL DRIVER:
--------------

A driver providing connectivity to MySQL databases using libmysqlclient
(http://www.mysql.org)

NOTES:
------

To allow for row seeking, results are loaded into memory. This is very
inefficient and may provide a bottleneck for large applications.

DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, DATE and TIME will all be treated as the DBI type of
DATETIME. This is currently a string, but will change in later releases.

WARNING: The DECIMAL type is treated as a string, as it has arbitrary
precision.

Whether or not a trailing \0 value will be added to Binary string can be
configured using:
  dbi_set_option_numeric("mysql_include_trailing_null",1); //include
  dbi_set_option_numeric("mysql_include_trailing_null",0); //don't include
(For convenience, a trailing zero byte always follows the data, so that string
casts can work. The above option just determines whether that byte is counted.)

The function implementing dbi_conn_sequence_last() returns "the value generated
for an AUTO_INCREMENT column by the previous INSERT or UPDATE statement".
Any sequence name passed as a parameter is ignored. (See the MySQL API function 
mysql_insert_id(), http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-insert-id.html )

The function implementing dbi_conn_sequence_next() does nothing; 
MySQL does not use named sequences.
