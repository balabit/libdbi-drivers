- Investigate further about Integers/Float types.
  
  Oracle stores all numeric types as SQLT_NUM (number) internaly.
  The only diffence with numeric columns is the set of contraints that 
  teels if there need to be a float or an interger or whatever.

  This makes it very hard to map numbers against libdbi's type system becouse everything 
  that you get from Oracle is an SQLT_NUM type internaly. SQLT_NUM has to be atleast an
  unsigned char[21] as external datatype.
  We need to fetch OCI_ATTR_SCALE using OCIAttrGet() to find out if 
  the column is a float column.

- Continue the work with Charsets mappings (Oracle to IANA).
  
- Implement other oracle types (Dates,refs ..).

- define driver capabilities.

- write documentation.
