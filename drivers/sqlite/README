SQLITE DRIVER:
--------------

A driver implementing an embedded SQL engine using libsqlite
(http://www.sqlite.org)
   


NOTES:
------

The sqlite driver ignores the host, port, username, and
password options completely as the sqlite access control works
entirely over the filesystem. If you're allowed to run an application
linked against libdbi and if the sqlite driver can be loaded from your
account, you have access to the "database server". If the file
containing the sqlite database is read/writable from your account, you
have read/write access to that database.

The sqlite driver uses one driver-specific option. In order to make
the operation as a libdbi driver feasible, you have to assign one
directory of your filesystem as the sqlite data directory by setting
the "sqlite_dbdir" option appropriately. The driver will look for
existing databases in this directory and it will create new databases
in the very same directory.
