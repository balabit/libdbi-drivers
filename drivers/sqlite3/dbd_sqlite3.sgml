    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para><ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</ulink> is a smart library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. No need for an external database server - an application linked against libsqlite can do it all by itself. Of course there are a few limitations of this approach compared to "real" SQL database servers, mostly for massively parallel high-throughput database applications, but on the other hand, installation and administration are a breeze.</para>
    <para>SQLite3 is a redesign of SQLite which is incompatible with the older 2.x versions. As the API functions and the library itself were renamed, SQLite3 also requires a slightly modified libdbi driver. You can have both the sqlite and the sqlite3 driver installed on your system, but you have to make sure that you access your databases with the driver that matches the database version.</para>
    <para>Your application should support the sqlite3 driver if one of the following applies:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>You want to support potential users of your application who don't have the skills to administer a database server.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>You want to offer the simplest possible installation of your application.</para>
      </listitem>

      <title>Build and install the sqlite3 driver</title>
      <para>First you have to unpack the libdbi-drivers archive in a suitable directory. Unpacking will create a new subdirectory <filename class="directory">libdbi-drivers-X.Y</filename> where "X.Y" denotes the version:</para>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>tar -xzf libdbi-drivers-0.7.2.tar.gz</userinput></screen>
      <para>The libdbi-drivers project consists of several drivers that use a common build system. Therefore you <emphasis>must</emphasis> tell configure explicitly that you want to build the sqlite3 driver (you can list as many drivers as you want to build):</para>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd libdbi-drivers</userinput></screen>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-sqlite3</userinput></screen>
      <para>Run <command>./configure --help</command> to find out about additional options.</para>
      <para>Then build the driver with the command:</para>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput></screen>
      <note>
	<para>Please note that you may have to invoke <command>gmake</command>, the GNU version of make, on some systems.</para>
      </note>
      <para>Then install the driver with the command (you'll need root permissions to do this):</para>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
      <para>To test the operation of the newly installed driver, use the command:</para>
      <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>
      <para>This command creates and runs a test program that performs a few basic input and output tests. The program will ask for a database name. This can be any name that is a valid filename on your system. It will also ask for a data directory. This is the directory that is used to create the test database. Needless to say that you need write access to that directory. If you accept the default ".", the database will be created in the <filename class="directory">tests</filename> subdirectory.</para>
      <note>
	<para>If for some reason you need to re-create the autoconf/automake-related files, try running <command moreinfo="none">./autogen.sh</command>. I've found out that the current stable autoconf/automake/libtool versions (as found in FreeBSD 4.7 and Debian 3.0) do not cooperate well, so I found it necessary to run the older autoconf 2.13. If necessary, edit <filename moreinfo="none">autogen.sh</filename> so that it will catch the older autoconf version on your system.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Driver options</title>
    <para>Your application has to initialize libdbi drivers by setting some driver options with the <function>dbi_conn_set_option()</function> and the <function>dbi_conn_set_option_numeric()</function> library functions. The sqlite driver supports the following options:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>dbname</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The name of the database you want to work with. As a SQLite database corresponds to one file in your filesystem, <varname>dbname</varname> can be any legal filename. If the database/file doesn't exist when you first try to access it, SQLite will create it on the fly.</para>
	  <para>It is important to understand that the full path of the database is composed of <varname>sqlite_dbdir</varname> and <varname>dbname</varname>. Therefore <varname>dbname</varname> should not contain the full path of a file, but just the name.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>sqlite_dbdir</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>This is the directory that contains all sqlite databases. Use the full path please.</para>
	  <note>
	    <para>It is necessary to keep all sqlite databases in one directory to make it possible to list all existing databases through the libdbi API.</para>
	  </note>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>sqlite_encoding</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>This option sets the character encoding used in the current connection. Allowed values are "UTF-8" and "UTF-16".</para>
	  <note>
	    <para>This setting affects the data storage format only if the database does not exist yet. An existing database will always use the storage format it was initialized for, but SQLite3 automatically converts the data to match the connection setting.</para>
	  </note>

  <chapter>
    <title>Peculiarities you should know about</title>
    <para>This chapter lists known peculiarities of the sqlite3 driver. This includes SQLite3 features that differ from what you know from the other database servers supported by libdbi, and it includes features and misfeatures introduced by the sqlite3 driver. It is the intention of the driver author to reduce the number of misfeatures in future releases if possible.</para>
    <sect1>
      <title>SQLite3 (mis)features</title>
      <para>As the SQLite3 package is constantly being improved, you should refer to the original documentation about the SQL features it <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html">supports</ulink> and about the SQL features it <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html">doesn't support</ulink>.</para>
      <para>One noticeable difference between SQLite3 and other SQL database engines is that the former uses something called "manifest typing". The practical difference to the typeless nature of SQLite 2.x is negligible as it still does not support the rich typing used by most other SQL database engines. In order to satisfy the needs of the strongly typed retrieval functions of libdbi, the only way out is to declare the column types in a <command>CREATE TABLE</command> statement just as you would with any other SQL database engine. As an example, the following statement is perfectly fine with SQLite3, but not with the sqlite3 driver:</para>
      <screen><userinput>CREATE TABLE foo (a,b,c)</userinput></screen>
      <para>However, the following statement is fine with SQLite3, the sqlite3 driver, and just about any other SQL database engine out there:</para>
      <screen><userinput>CREATE TABLE foo (a INTEGER,b TEXT,c VARCHAR(64))</userinput></screen>
      <para>The following table lists the column types which are positively recognized by the sqlite driver. Essentially all column types supported by MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported by this driver as well, making it reasonably easy to write portable SQL code. All other column types are treated as strings.</para>

	    </row>
	  </tbody>
	</tgroup>
      </table>
      <para>Another difference is the lack of access control on the database engine level. Most SQL database servers implement some mechanisms to restrict who is allowed to fiddle with the databases and who is not. As SQLite3 uses regular files to store its databases, all available access control is on the filesystem level. There is no SQL interface to this kind of access control, but <command>chmod</command> and <command>chown</command> are your friends.</para>
      <para>In contrast to SQLite2.x, SQLite3 appears to implement row and column counters as C long long int values. This allows the same maximum number of rows as in most other SQL database engines.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>sqlite driver misfeatures</title>
      <para>And now we have to discuss how successful the sqlite driver is in squeezing the SQLite idea of a database engine into the libdbi framework which was shaped after MySQL and PostgreSQL. Keep in mind that the limitations mentioned here are not intrinsic (except maybe the first one which is beyond our control), that is a sufficient amount of coding might fix these problems eventually.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>SQLite3 handles auto-increment columns in a fairly non-intuitive way. Only the type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY auto-increments. As a user of other database engine you might expect the row IDs to be 4-byte integers (they were in 2.x), but nope: they are in fact 8-byte integers, and therefore equivalent to INT8 or BIGINT of other engines. This leaves us with the odd "feature" of the sqlite3 driver that INTEGER is a 4-byte integer, whereas INTEGER PRIMARY KEY is a 8-bit integer type. If this were not the case, auto-incrementing columns would be artificially limited to the range of 4-byte integers. On the other hand this means that you cannot declare a real 4-byte integer auto-incrementing column.</para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>Do not forget to use <function moreinfo="none">dbi_result_get_longlong()</function> or <function moreinfo="none">dbi_result_get_ulonglong</function> to retrieve values from columns declared as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.</para>
	  </warning>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The (essentially) typeless nature of SQLite has some nasty consequences. The sqlite driver takes great care to reconstruct the type of a field that you request in a query, but this isn't always successful. Some of the functions that SQLite supports work both on numeric and text data. The sqlite driver currently cannot deduce the field type correctly as it would have to check all arguments of each function. Instead the sqlite driver makes a few assumptions that may be right or wrong in a given case. The affected functions are <function>coalesce(X,Y,...)</function>, <function>max(X)</function>, <function>min(X)</function>, and <function>count(X)</function>.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The sqlite driver currently assumes that the directory separator of your filesystem is a slash (/). This may be wrong on your particular system. It is not a problem for Windows systems as long as the sqlite driver is built with the Cygwin tools (see <filename>README.win32</filename>).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Listing tables with the <function>dbi_conn_get_table_list()</function> libdbi function currently returns only permanent tables. Temporary tables are ignored.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The sqlite driver assumes that table and field names do not exceed 128 characters in length, including the trailing \0. I don't know whether SQLite internally has such a limit or not (both MySQL and PostgreSQL have a lower limit). The limit can be increased by changing a single #define in the <filename moreinfo="none">dbd_sqlite.h</filename> header file.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>In a few cases, the sqlite driver expects you to type SQL keywords in all lowercase or all uppercase, but not mixed. This holds true for the 'from' in a SELECT statement. Type it either as 'from' or as 'FROM', but refrain from using 'fRoM' or other funny mixtures of uppercase and lowercase. Most other database engines treat the keywords as case-insensitive and would accept all variants.</para>
